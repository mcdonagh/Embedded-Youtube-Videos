# Embedded Youtube Videos
Automatically changes the URL of a youtube link from **`watch?v=`** to **`embed/`**

> Original URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO-CODE
>
> Redirect URL: https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO-CODE

## Why? What's the Point?
I watch a lot of youtube videos and got tired of manually closing the chat replays on videos of live streams.  
Found a [reddit post](https://reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/89ugd8/how_can_i_disable_the_chat_replay_when_watching_a/dzh7s7a/) with a tip to change the url and liked it better than the default viewing experience.  
Made this because I didn't want to manually change the url for every video I watched.
